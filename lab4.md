Hey everyone! I'm Derrick and today I'll be through a few commands! A few of which will be done in **Vim**. 

We will be going over steps 4-9 in lab 7:
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

# Logging into ieng6**

So by now, if you have been paying attention during lab, you should know how to do this, but to those who don't:

1. Open your terminal on your desktop or in VsCode
2. type `shh cs15lsp23xx@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
3. Enter your password (this step can be skipped with the instructions making an ssh key in lab 7)

Once you log in, you should be prompted a screen showing that you have logged in, now we can move onto the next step!

# Cloning a fork of a repository from your personal Github account**

Throughout the entirety of this course, we have forked many repositories from TAs, staff, and from Prof. Politz. Now it's our turn! We will be forking the repository to our own Github accounts then cloning the repository from our personal account.

In order to do this, we will do the following:
1. Visit <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7"> this page </a> to find the repository we want to fork.
2. Then click fork at the top right and bring it into your own account.
3. Now that we have the forked repository on our account, we can run `git clone https://github.com/username/lab7` to clone a copy onto our remote server account.
4. **additional step if you already have a cloned repository and you want to remove it: type `rm -rf directoryName`
