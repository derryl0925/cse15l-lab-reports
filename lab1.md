## **Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem**
Hey everyone! I'm Derrick and today I'll be guiding you through **remote access** in CSE 15L. To start, you will have to:
1. Log into your CSE 15L course-specific account on **ieng6** and change the password (optional)
2. Install VScode
3. Install git (if on Windows, allows you to use Mac/Linux commands on Windows*) *Windows commmands are different*
