Hey everyone! I'm Derrick and today I'll be guiding you through commands in CSE 15L. There are a few interesting commands, `less`, `find`, and `grep`. Today we will take a deeper look and dive into the command `**grep**`!

We will be going over:
1. Four interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use `**grep**`
2. Two examples for each option using it on files and directories from `./technical`, which was a directory given in CSE 15L
